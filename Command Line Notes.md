## **Terminal _vs_ Command Line _vs_ Shell**

**Terminal** - Tool that you use to type and execute commands. Used to be hardware, now we use **"treminal emulaor"** software.

**Command Line** - The interface of the terminal. Windows often calls their terminal program the **"command line"**. The 2 terms are used interchangebly.

**The Shell** - The program that the terminal runs. The **"OS"** of the terminal.

## **Let's Talk About Windows**

Windows used to use a shell calles **COMMAND.COM** that was later switched to **COM.EXE**. It is very limiting.

Windows also offers **Powershell**, which has different commands (and some of the same) than Bash, ZSH and other Unix-based shells.

There are a lot of Unix-based solutions for Windows including **Git Bash** and **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).**
